Requirements of Technical Specification Document

Describe each game feature from a technical perspective
Identify programming difficulties of each feature
Define / pseudo-code core functions each feature will need
Include the performance impact of each feature

Identify dependencies or assumptions
Does this code need any libraries or rely on pre-written code?
  - relies on volume assets
Are there design assumptions which are actually entire features?
  -

Prioritize each feature (with reasoning)
  - microphone support
  - collision detection with barriers
  - increased difficulty with levels
  - leaderboard
  - art (probably last)

Feasibility analysis
What are the most difficult items to program regarding technical difficulty?
  - collision?
  - microphone support translated to momentum
What are the commitments regarding time needed to program?
 Identify technical issues with the design
  - none identifiable right now

Data storage and variables
Layout and list all variables,
  - high score (int)
  - volume levels (decibel, int)

Label functionality of each variable
  - high score increases linearly along with time spent in game.
  - decibel influences height
Call out any data structures needed for program operation
  -
Identify which data is global and which is local
  - global - high scores
  - 

Functional code relational map
How do functions relate to one another
Which functions are called for which part of the program
